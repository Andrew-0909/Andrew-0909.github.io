What was challenging for you during this process?
 The thing that was challenging for me was some of the codes were repeating so it was a little confusing. For example, changing the color randomly when the shapes collide and making the shape color was almost similar to each other


What makes more sense now than it did before you started?
The distance function makes more sense than before because this project requires changing the shape direction when they collide with each other. 


What are you proud of?

Iâ€™m proud of finishing this project before the due date.
