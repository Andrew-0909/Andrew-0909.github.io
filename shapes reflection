During the process of creating my first P5 sketch, the point that I found most challenging was that there were so many codes that needed to be written down. However, I now know how to make changes to colors and shapes in addition to the x, y, and z coordinates. I feel a great sense of achievement because I feel that I made considerable improvements to my coding skills.
