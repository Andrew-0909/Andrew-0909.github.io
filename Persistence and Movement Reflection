What was challenging for you during this process?
It was challenging to use mathematics in coding and to utilize codes that are different from those used in our previous project.

What makes more sense now than it did before you started?
At the present time, I am more aware of ways to move objects and realize different speeds.

What are you proud of?
Iâ€™m simply proud of the fact that I was able to complete this difficult project over the past weekend.
