The two objects will be a circle and a rectangle. The circle will have a radius r and a position (x1, y1). The rectangle will have a width w and a height h.

To determine if the circle and rectangle are touching, I'll check if the distance between the circle's center (x1, y1) and the nearest edge or corner of the rectangle is less than or equal to the radius r.

Upon detecting contact, Iâ€™ll have the objects "bounce" by reversing their movement directions.
